Read-only reconcile scope $ARGUMENTS through `hulane_status` with GitHub refresh for each requested Work Item, followed by `hulane_validate`. GitHub machine state and live PR/Actions facts outrank cache; MCP may refresh only local cache/projection. Do not alter product code or GitHub objects. Show Waiting Approval, Developing, Testing, Review, PR Checking, Waiting Human Merge, Waiting Tag Confirm, Building, Waiting Close, Blocked, and Recently Done. Include ID/title/Issue/revision/branch/worktree/agent/rework budget/PR/checks/risk/delivery/spec sync (spec_sync_required, specs_synced, specs_commit_sha)/build/image/next action, and flag any waiting_close item with spec_sync_required true and specs_synced unrecorded as pending spec sync before close.
